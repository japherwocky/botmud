"""Guard: production code must never read Character.equipment by a string slot key.

ROM keys equipped objects by the integer wear slot — `get_eq_char(ch, int iWear)`
(`src/handler.c:1733`) loops `obj->wear_loc == iWear`; there are no string slot
names in ROM. Python's `Character.equipment` is therefore keyed strictly by
`int(WearLocation.X)`. The write paths (`do_wear`, `Character.equip_object`, the
JSON restore in `from_orm`) all canonicalize via
`mud.models.constants.canonical_wear_slot`; every reader must look up the int key.

A string-literal access like `equipment.get("wield")` or `equipment["shield"]`
silently misses objects equipped under the canonical int key — exactly the class
of bug fixed in 2.9.87 (school-banner light uncounted in room lighting; worn
shield invisible to the combat shield check). This scanner fails loudly if any
such access reappears, the same way `test_rng_determinism.py` bans `random.*`.

See AGENTS.md "Equipment lookup" and
docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md INV-028.
