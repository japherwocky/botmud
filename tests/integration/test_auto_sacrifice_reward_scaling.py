"""Regression guard — AUTOSAC silver reward scales with corpse level.

ROM `src/act_obj.c:1822` computes the sacrifice reward as::

    silver = UMAX (1, obj->level * 3);

We deliberately raise that floor from 1 to 5 to be kinder to new players,
giving ``max(5, obj->level * 3)``. The corpse still inherits the dead mob's
level via `src/fight.c:1504` ``corpse->level = ch->level``, so a level-2
corpse yields 6 silver and a level-5 corpse 15, while levels 0 and 1 both
land on the floor of 5.

`mud/combat/engine.py:_auto_sacrifice` implements this with
``max(5, corpse_level * 3)``. This guard pins the per-level reward so a
future regression that drops ``corpse.level`` back to 0 (the symptom
that surfaced live: a level-1 "wimpy monster" paying only 1 silver
because its corpse came through level 0) fails loudly here instead of
shipping silently — the manual `do_sacrifice` path was covered, but the
AUTOSAC reward amount was previously unguarded (only the flag toggles
and the TO_ROOM broadcast had tests).
