"""FIGHT-055 enforcement — xp_compute alignment mutation + multiplier snapshot.

ROM src/fight.c:1878-1914 xp_compute has two contracts Python violated:

SUB-GAP A — zero base_exp does not skip alignment mutation:
    When level_range < -9, base_exp == 0.  ROM still runs the alignment block.
    UMAX(1, change) forces change=1 when align > 500 or align < -500, even though
    base_exp==0 makes the raw arithmetic give 0.  Python returned early at
    `if base_exp <= 0: return 0`, skipping the alignment write entirely.

    ROM src/fight.c:1890-1895:
        align = victim->alignment - gch->alignment;
        else if (align > 500) {
            change = (align - 500) * base_exp / 500 * gch->level / total_levels;  // == 0
            change = UMAX(1, change);   // == 1  <-- still fires!
            gch->alignment = UMAX(-1000, gch->alignment - change);  // decremented by 1

SUB-GAP B — XP multiplier reads post-mutation gch->alignment:
    Python captured a snapshot `gch_alignment` before mutation and used it in the
    XP multiplier branch conditions (ROM src/fight.c:1916+).  A character whose
    alignment crosses a threshold during mutation gets the wrong multiplier path.

    ROM src/fight.c:1916 (post mutation block):
        else if (gch->alignment > 500) {  /* goodie two shoes  */
    Python (pre-mutation snapshot):
        elif gch_alignment > 500:   # BUG: uses old value
