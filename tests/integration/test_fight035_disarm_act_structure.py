"""FIGHT-035 — disarm uses ROM's TO_CHAR/TO_VICT/TO_NOTVICT split + colour + PERS.

ROM splits every disarm outcome into three distinct ``act()`` legs, and the
TO_NOTVICT leg excludes **both** the kicker (``ch``) and the victim — so neither
actor receives the third-person bystander line, and a bystander receives it
exactly once.

Fail path (``src/fight.c:3211-3215`` ``do_disarm``):
  * TO_CHAR    ``"{5You fail to disarm $N.{x"``
  * TO_VICT    ``"{5$n tries to disarm you, but fails.{x"``
  * TO_NOTVICT ``"{5$n tries to disarm $N, but fails.{x"``

NOREMOVE path (``src/fight.c:2244-2248`` ``disarm``):
  * TO_CHAR    ``"{5$S weapon won't budge!{x"`` (``$S`` = victim's gendered possessive)
  * TO_VICT    ``"{5$n tries to disarm you, but your weapon won't budge!{x"``
  * TO_NOTVICT ``"{5$n tries to disarm $N, but fails.{x"``

Success path (``src/fight.c:2252-2255`` ``disarm``):
  * TO_VICT    ``"{5$n DISARMS you and sends your weapon flying!{x"`` (note CAPS)
  * TO_CHAR    ``"{5You disarm $N!{x"``
  * TO_NOTVICT ``"{5$n disarms $N!{x"``

The Python port baked both names, dropped the ``{5``/``{x`` colour, lower-cased
"DISARMS", rendered ``$S`` as ``"<name>'s"`` instead of the gendered possessive,
and — the correctness bug — passed the TO_NOTVICT line through ``_act_room`` with
only **one** actor excluded, so the other actor double-received the third-person
room line.
