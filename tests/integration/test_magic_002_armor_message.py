"""Regression for MAGIC-002 / FINDING-015 (differential `affect_armor` scenario, 2026-05-29).

ROM `spell_armor` (`src/magic.c:753-777`) sends "You feel someone protecting you."
to the victim on a successful cast (and `act("$N is protected by your magic.")` to
the caster for a cross-target cast); the already-affected branch is
"You are already armored." / `act("$N is already armored.")`. The Python `armor`
handler applied the -20 AC affect but was *silent* on success, and since `do_cast`
is silent on a successful cast (FINDING-013 — all output comes from the spell
function), the line was dropped entirely.

Surfaced by the `affect_armor` differential scenario, step 3 (`cast armor`):
  C : ['You feel someone protecting you.']
  py: []
(affects/eff_ac/mana all converged — only `output` diverged.)

ROM C: src/magic.c:753-777 (spell_armor).
