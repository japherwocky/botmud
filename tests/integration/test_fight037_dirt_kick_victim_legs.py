"""FIGHT-037 — dirt-kick victim legs: ``$n`` PERS + ``{5..{x`` colour, no invented caster line.

ROM ``do_dirt`` success branch (``src/fight.c:2611-2631``) emits exactly three
visible lines on a hit:

  * ``:2614`` TO_ROOM  — ``"{5$n is blinded by the dirt in $s eyes!{x"`` (victim
    subject; reaches the kicker too — handled by FIGHT-036's ``act_to_room``,
    which excludes only the victim).
  * ``:2616`` TO_VICT  — ``"{5$n kicks dirt in your eyes!{x"`` (kicker subject,
    rendered per the victim via ``PERS(ch, victim)`` — an invisible kicker masks
    to "someone" — wrapped in the ``{5``/``{x`` colour codes).
  * ``:2618`` send_to_char — ``"{5You can't see a thing!{x"`` to the victim.

The success branch sends the **kicker NO self message** — the kicker only sees
the ``:2614`` blind line as a room recipient.

The Python port (1) baked the kicker name and dropped the colour on the TO_VICT
leg, (2) dropped the colour on the victim self-line, and (3) **invented** a
``"You kick dirt in <victim>'s eyes!"`` caster line ROM never emits.
