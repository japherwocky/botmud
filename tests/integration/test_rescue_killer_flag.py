"""`do_rescue` must flag a clan PC rescuer KILLER when it joins a PvP fight.

FIGHT-030 — ROM `do_rescue` calls ``check_killer(ch, fch)`` (`src/fight.c:3097`)
between the two ``stop_fighting`` and the two ``set_fighting`` calls
(`src/fight.c:3094-3099`). When the rescued ally is fighting **another PC**
(``fch`` is not an NPC), the rescuer joins that PvP fight and ROM flags it with
``PLR_KILLER`` + killer timer exactly as ``do_kill``/``do_murder`` would.

``do_rescue``'s only kill-stealing guard (`src/fight.c:3075`, Python
`combat.py:do_rescue`) is **NPC-gated** — it blocks only when ``fch`` is an NPC
and the rescuer is not grouped with the victim. So a PC-vs-PC rescue proceeds,
which is precisely the case ``check_killer`` exists to flag. The Python port
performed the ``stop_fighting``/``set_fighting`` swap but skipped
``check_killer``, so the rescuer escaped the PK consequences ROM imposes.

The placement is load-bearing: ``check_killer`` must run **before**
``set_fighting(caster, foe)`` — its ``attacker.fighting is resolved_victim``
guard (`engine.py:1291`) early-returns once the rescuer is already fighting the
foe, so flagging after the swap would silently never fire.
