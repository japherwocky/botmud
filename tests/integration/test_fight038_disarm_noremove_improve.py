"""FIGHT-038 — a NOREMOVE ("won't budge") disarm credits skill improvement TRUE.

ROM ``do_disarm`` (``src/fight.c:3202-3217``) only enters the success branch on a
made roll (``number_percent() < chance``); that branch calls ``disarm(ch, victim)``
and then, unconditionally, ``check_improve(ch, gsn_disarm, TRUE, 1)`` (``:3206``).
The NOREMOVE "won't budge" case lives inside ``disarm()`` (``src/fight.c:2242-2249``)
— it emits the budge messages and ``return``s, so control falls back to ``:3206``
and the disarm is still credited as a skill *success* for improvement.

The Python port's NOREMOVE early-return called ``check_improve(caster, "disarm",
False, 1)`` — crediting a failure. This test pins ROM's TRUE.
