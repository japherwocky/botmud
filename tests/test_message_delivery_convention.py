"""Guard: production code must not deliver to a character's ``messages`` mailbox
directly — connected PCs must receive output through the single-delivery
chokepoint, never the mailbox alone.

ROM C ``src/comm.c:write_to_buffer`` writes one message to a player's descriptor:
a single delivery channel.  Python cannot do synchronous socket writes inside the
synchronous game tick, so connected characters receive messages via
``asyncio.create_task(send_to_char(...))`` and the ``char.messages`` list is a
**test / disconnected-character fallback only** (see AGENTS.md "Message Delivery
(Architectural Divergence)" and ``docs/divergences/MESSAGE_DELIVERY.md``).

Two failure modes this scanner exists to catch — both INV-001 SINGLE-DELIVERY
violations (``docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md``):

1. **Mailbox-only for a connected PC.** The connection read loop drains
   ``char.messages`` only after the player's *next* command, so a message
   appended to the mailbox during a tick is invisible until the player types
   something.  This was SPEC-017 (spec-fun room flavor) and the tick-aggression
   class of v2.14.115.
2. **Dual delivery.** Appending to *both* the async send and the mailbox replays
   the line on the next prompt for connected PCs.

The canonical chokepoint is ``mud.utils.messaging.push_message`` (and
``send_to_char_buffered``), which routes a connected PC to the async socket
*xor* the mailbox.  Use it instead of touching ``<entity>.messages`` directly.

This is the same static-guard pattern as ``test_rng_determinism.py`` and
``test_equipment_key_convention.py`` (Layer-A in
``docs/parity/DIVERGENCE_CLASS_ROSTER.md``).

Allowlist policy
----------------
``_LEGITIMATE`` holds the genuine single-delivery chokepoints, the mailbox
accessor, and the read-only mailbox inspectors — these are correct by design.

``_INV001_DEBT`` holds known mailbox bypasses not yet migrated to the chokepoint,
frozen here so the guard ships green while preventing *new* bypasses.  Each is an
INV-001 "Touched by" site in the cross-file tracker; fixing one means routing it
through ``push_message`` and deleting its line below.  The orphan check keeps the
allowlist honest: an entry that no longer matches any line fails the test, so a
closed debt entry cannot rot.

NOTE: ``skill.messages`` is a dict of ROM message templates, NOT a character
mailbox — the ``getattr(skill, ...)`` form is excluded by the pattern below.
