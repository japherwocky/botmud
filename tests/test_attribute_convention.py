"""Guard: production code must use the canonical ROM-port attribute names.

AGENTS.md "ROM Parity Rules" mandates:
  - character inventory is `char.inventory`, never `char.carrying`
  - room occupants are `room.people`, never `room.characters`
  - equipped gear is `char.equipment` (int-keyed), never `char.equipped`
    (the `char.equipped["held"]` anti-pattern — `.equipped` doesn't exist, so it
    silently reads `{}`; this caused the `compare`-vs-worn-weapon bug fixed 2.9.87)

These are not behavioral bugs on their own, but the wrong name silently reads a
non-existent / stale attribute. The codebase is currently clean (0 occurrences);
this scanner locks that in the same way `test_rng_determinism.py` bans `random.*`
and `test_equipment_key_convention.py` bans string-keyed equipment access.

If a legitimate future use of one of these names ever appears on an unrelated
class, narrow the pattern — do not delete the guard.
